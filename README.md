# SimpleSynthesizer
A small synthesizer written in C#.

This program contains a small synthesizer form, which allows to play a small wave file which will be generated by clicking at the button "Start Oscillator".
The wave file will be generated from an AudioData-Object which contains a MemoryStream. This stream will be loaded into a MediaPlayer-Object which will play a looped sound of the wave file.

Considerations:
To create a more useful synthsizer it would be better to use a continous audio stream where only the samples of the audio file would be manipulated and not a whole wave file will be generated.
It would create a better listening experience and no stuttering if some changes are being made through the user settings.
 
However the time was to short to implement a better and more suitable version. Maybe I will update it further in the future.
